Assignment 1, Part 2.

1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C#?

Use string when you know the string object will stay constant. Use stringbuilder when you want it to be mutable. 

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?

The object class. 

3. How do you sort an array in C#?

You utilize the sort method built into the base array class. 

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?

You canutilize the count() method, or perhaps the getlength method. 

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?

yes, if you create an object array. All types inherit from the object type, and as such, an array of objects can support different types inside a sinle array. You can also use an arraylist collection.

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?

System.array.copyto changes the references of another existing array to point to the elements in the original array, whereas .clone() returns a new array object referring to all the elements in the original array.
