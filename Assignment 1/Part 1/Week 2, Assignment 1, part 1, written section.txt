Test your Knowledge, Understanding Data Types:	
	1. What type would you choose for the following numbers:
		- A person's telephone number - uLong
		- A person's height - Assuming we'll be using sensible units like centimeters, meters, inches, or feet, and assuming we will be including fractions of the measurement unit, float would be a good choice.
		- A person's age - Assuming we won't include fractions of age, byte seems reasonable
		- A person's gender - enum
		- A person's salary - decimal
		- A book's ISBN - long
		- A book's price - decimal
		- A book's shipping weight: double
		- A country's population: uint
		- Number of star's in the universe: float, if a quick google search is 
		- The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the UK (50000 employees per business): google search shows 1.4 million small or medium size business in the uk with employees. Assuming 50000 per business, we get a max of 1.4 million * 50000 =  70000000000, so long
		
	2. Differences between value type and reference type variables?
		- value type directly stores its data in its own memory space. Has its own copy of data, and operations on one cannot effect operations on another. They are stored in stacks.
		- Reference types store pointers to the memory locations holding the actual data. STored in heaps.
	
		Boxing vs unboxing?
		- boxing is the act of casting a value type to an object type, whereas unboxing is casting the object is cast back into a value type. 
		
	3. Managed resource and unmanaged resource in .net:
		unmanaged resources are things that the garbage collector won't know how to clean up after if they are abandoned. Managed resources are those that the garbage collector will know how to handle after they are left behind.
	4. Garbage collector purpose in .net?
		Basically manages the allocation and release of utilized memory for an application. Means you don't have to write code to perform memory management tasks, eliminating common problems such as forgetting to free objects, memory leaks, or attempting to access memory for an object that has already been freed.

Test your knowledge, Controlling flow and converting types:
	1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0? 
		Throws a dividebyzero exception
	
	2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
		You get infinity

	3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
		You get an integral constant too large error.
		
	4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;
		the prefix form returns the incremented value of y, while also incrementing y 
		the suffix form returns the original value of y, while incrementing y itself
		
	5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
		Break ends the closest enclosing iteration or switch statement and transfers control to the next statement. 
		
	6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
		An iterator variable, the condition under which the loop will continue, and something to increment the iterator variable.
		
	7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
		== is a comparative operator whereas = is an assignment operator
		
	8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
		Yes, but it will not stop looping. 
		
	9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
		Replaces the default character in a switch statement.
		
	10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement?
		Ienumerable or Ienumerator
